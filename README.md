This is an application in which users can order products. 
They can select a category to shop from, add products to their cart, and place an order.
An administrative user can login (after creating an account using the company password which is "Electronics613") 
and manage the categories and poducts, and view the orders in order to fill them.

To get the project up and running: 
In your command line, navigate to the ECommerce.Data folder. 
Once in the correct folder, type dotnet ef database update in the command line. 
This will create a database in SQL Server and then the project will be able to run.
